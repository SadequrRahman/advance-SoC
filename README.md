# Project Descrption

This repositiory is intended to upload and manage lab solution for ***Advance System-On-Chip Design***. Learning objective of the course are following
* Learning the ISA of the Tiny-RISCV processor and programming some assembler programs for this ISA.
* Learning the python based HDL by describing and testing some simple hardware components.
* Extending the given, but uncompleted pipelined Tiny-RISCV processor model with some new instructions.
* Extending the Tiny-RISCV processor with an accelerator.
    
During this course we will be using fifth genaration **RISC** degisn ***(from UC Berkely)***, A high-quality, license-free, royalty-free RISC ISA architecture, to complete the lab task. Documentation are found in **DOC** directory in this repository including all lab instraction and other useful materials.
